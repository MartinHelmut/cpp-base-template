# Base project setup

C++ project template.

## Setup

This project requires [Litr](https://github.com/krieselreihe/litr).

Quick setup to build and run the application:

```shell
litr build,start
```

## Disclaimer

And in-depth guide for the project template can be found at the [blog post I wrote](https://martin-fieber.de/blog/basic-cpp-setup-with-dependency-management) at my website.
